            <p class="h3">In 2007, a tentative agreement to host the Indian Grand Prix was reached between the Indian
                Olympic
                Association and Bernie Ecclestone, then chief-executive of the Formula One Group. A site in Greater
                Noida in
                the
                north Indian state of Uttar Pradesh was chosen as the location of the track that would host the race.[8]
                Delays
                in the procurement of the land and construction were reported in early 2009 owing in part to the ongoing
                financial crisis.[9] The design of the track was ultimately revealed in November 2009.[10]

                The venue was slated to debut during the 2010 Formula One season, with construction scheduled to be
                completed in
                time. However, this date was pushed back and the inaugural race eventually took place the following
                year.

            <p class="h5">The circuit is part of the 2,500 acres (1,000 ha) Jaypee Greens Sports City,[31] which has
                increasingly delayed plans to include a 100,000 seating capacity international cricket stadium, 18-hole
                golf
                course, 25,000 seat field hockey stadium and a sports academy. The circuit design incorporated feedback
                from
                the
                teams on how the circuit could be altered to improve overtaking. This resulted in some minor changes
                before
                2010: the planned hairpin at turn seven was removed, and the track at turn three was widened to allow
                drivers to
                take different lines throughout the corner. More information was released in August 2010, revealing that
                there
                were plans to make the circuit one of the most challenging for drivers, with the circuit rising fourteen
                metres
                within the first three corners alone and a banked double-apex bend on the far side of the circuit,[34]
                nicknamed
                the Currybolica, as a reference to the infamous banked Parabolica corner on the Monza Circuit in Italy.
                The
                track has since been praised by drivers, including Lewis Hamilton who compared it to the classic.</p><br><br><br><br>

                of

                race. The seating capacity is initially expected to be 110,000[30] with provisions to increase it to
